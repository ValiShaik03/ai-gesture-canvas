<h1>🖐️ AI Gesture Canvas</h1><br>
AI Gesture Canvas is an intuitive, real-time drawing system that lets you sketch on a virtual canvas using only your hand gestures. Powered by MediaPipe and OpenCV, this project supports color selection, shape recognition, live stroke preview, and undo/redo — all without touching a mouse or keyboard.<br>

<h1>🚀 Features</h1><br>
🖌️ Draw with your index finger<br>
🎨 Color palette with gesture selection<br>
🔁 Undo / Redo functionality<br>
🧠 AI-based shape recognition (Triangle, Rectangle, Circle)<br>
🗣️ Voice assistant integration (planned)<br>
🖼️ Save your drawings as images<br>
👆 Smooth gesture tracking using MediaPipe<br>
